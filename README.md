# Bachelor Thesis
at the Chair of Automatic Control (Faculty of Engineering - CAU Kiel)

This Git-Repository holds all the Code written for my Bachelor Thesis at the Chair of Automatic Control at TF Uni Kiel.
The Programming Language is Python.

Some Libraries that I used:
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [OpenAI Gym and Roboschool](https://gym.openai.com/)

#### Update Mo., 09.07.2018
* TW-Circuit now takes Gap-Junction-Currents - BUT still outputs weird Plots and Results - PLEASE HELP!

#### Update Fr. 29.06.2018
* Some breakthroughs at modelling the formulas from the Paper "TW Neuronal Circuit" - got a very promising LIF Simulation out of variating the Constants in Project "TW-Circuit" - will continue this Idea and maybe implement a Network from there.

#### Update Fr. 22.06.2018
* Added a new Project "WaterLevel_RL" which was a first try to implement a Water Level regulator with a nerual network - still under development and not quite sure, if I continue this Idea

#### Update Mo. 18.06.2018
* Implementation of a very substantial neural network in lif_model/single_neuron_net.py


#### Update Fr. 15.06.2018
* New Library "DyNetwork" for my own neural Network and some other purposes initialized - Still no serious content.
